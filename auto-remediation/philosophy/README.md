# Auto-Remediation Philosophy

Auto-remediation in database systems must prioritize **data integrity over speed**.

This framework enforces:
- Explicit approval boundaries
- Rollback-first design
- Context-aware remediation

No remediation occurs without:
- Validation
- Human review
- Clear rollback strategy
